# Warning. Do not change the code on line 1. Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any two-digit number.
# The last line of your program should print the result.

# Instructions: Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.
# The BMI is a measure of someone's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.
# The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):
# NOTE: You should convert the bmi to a whole number and print out a whole number in order to pass all the tests. See examples below.
# Example Input 1: 1.75, 80
# means: weight = 80 and height = 1.75
# Example Output 1: 26
# Since: 80 Ã· (1.75 x 1.75) = 26.122448979591837
# Example Input 2: 1.58, 57
# Example Output 1: 22
# 1st input: enter height in meters e.g: 1.65
height = input()
# 2nd input: enter weight in kilograms e.g: 72

# Instructionsï¼š I was reading this article by Tim Urban - Your Life in Weeks and realised just how little time we actually have.
# Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many weeks we have left, if we live until 90 years old.
# It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:
# You have x weeks left.
# Where x is replaced with the actual calculated number of weeks the input age has left until age 90.
# Warning your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops.
# Example Input: 56
# Example Output: You have 1768 weeks left.
